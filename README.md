Short explaination about new files that were added:
- scrape_reviews_and_scores.py - this file was used to scrape reviews and categories scores from BOOKING.com
- train_scores_model.py - this file was used to create models to score reviews per each category
- rank_reviews_per_category.py - this file was used to rank the reviews that were used for simulations by the trained models
- categories_score_data folder - this folder contains the trained models and a csv summerizing the F1 score of each model
- Few csv were added to the 'data' folder, including the scraped results and the predictions of the categories models.

  Additionally, one sweep was accidentilly deleted after the results were already saved to csv, so the csv was also uploaded to 'RunningScripts' folder.
